This water is used for "free cooling" and is directed to buildings through an insulated underground piping network. When the water enters the building, it flows through a heat exchanger, absorbing heat from the building space. The water is then recirculated back to the central plant through a closed loop piping system. The district cooling system is an effective and sustainable solution for cooling with energy optimization in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Thye may also have to change their layouts so that those patients most threatened by heat are accomodated in coolerparts of the building. For example, in a hospital in Ahmedabad, India, the maternity ward was on the fourth and reportedly, hottest floor. After a heatwave in May 2021, the ward was relocated to the ground floor where it is much cooler. Analysis of this shift indicates that it had  a protective effect with fewer heat-related admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.

A wind-catcher was a building specially designed to trap wind in hollowed out spaces and funnelling it down to the lower levels of a building, cooling off the inhabitants as it reduced the heat of the wind. It is also called Badgir, this is a wind tower a traditional Persian architectural element used for centuries for natural ventilation of buildings. Badgirs are still used today in a wide variety of ways. A badgir usually has at least two vertical channels.

It is sometimes known as the thermal flywheel effect. It can be used to even out variations in internal and external conditions, absorbing heat as temperatures rise and releasing it as they fall. An example is a trombe wall placed in front of a south-facing window will absorb solar radiation and then slowly release it into the enclosed space.
202 0.3189036985147767 0.22221435763403813 [202] Mechanical or Forced Ventilation Driven by Fans: This might be cooled below outside air temperature by the use of refrigerants or by thermal mass such as thermal labyrinths, or by night time purging. Mechanical fans drive mechanical ventilation. Fans can either be installed directly in windows or walls, or installed in air ducts for supplying air into, or exhausting air from, a room. The type of mechanical ventilation used depends on climate. In warm and humid climates, infiltration may need to be minimized or prevented to reduce interstitial condensation (which occurs when warm, moist air from inside a building penetrates a wall, roof or floor and meets a cold surface). In these cases, a positive pressure mechanical ventilation system is often used. Conversely, in cold climates, exfiltration needs to be prevented to reduce interstitial condensation, and negative pressure ventilation is used.
